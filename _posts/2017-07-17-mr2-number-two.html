<p>First owner put 208,000 miles on it. Second owner, Ross, bought in 2003 and owned until I bought it.</p>

<p>First owner had tons of stuff replaced at dealership apparently, until the end. When Ross bought it, he fixed door locks and a few small things. He did the motor swap about 7-8,000 miles ago, but miles were mostly track miles since being done, hence the 15,000 mile estimate. This was probably about 7 years ago. That's the last time transmission/coolant were messed with.</p>

<p>Ross did all of the modifications.</p>
